## Patlet / Overview

A succinct 1-2 sentence description of the problem and its solution.

## Problem

Clearly define the problem.
A brief description, typically no more than a few sentences, outlining the issues and challenges.
Avoid blending with information from other sections below.

## Context

Where is the problem situated?
What are the preconditions?
**Immutable** before implementing the solution.
The content in this section often determines the pattern's relevance for other readers: "Is my situation similar?"

## Solutions

Proven and potential solutions to the problem.

## Resulting Context

What is the situation after addressing the problem?
The initial context is indirectly altered by the solution.
This section may include a discussion on subsequent patterns or problems that could emerge.
The content in this section can be brief - the solution might not introduce new issues or significantly alter the context.

## Example

Where has this been observed before?
This reinforces that the pattern is genuine and that your context aligns with it.

Might mention:

* A specific company
* Anonymized instances, e.g., "3 companies have demonstrated this to be an effective solution" or "A large financial services organization...".
